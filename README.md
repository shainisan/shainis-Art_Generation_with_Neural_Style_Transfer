Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer

To celebrate finishing the "Convolutional Neural Networks" course by DeepLearning.AI on Coursera (amazing course!! hard and satisfying), I've created a small project using Gradio and Hugging Face to demonstrate the implementation of the Neural Style Transfer algorithm, generating artistic images using this fascinating algorithm. Isn't it cool? ðŸ˜Š
